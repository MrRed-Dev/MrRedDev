This repository is mostly about me, my ideas, and what I documented along my Cybersecurity journey.
Wireless Protocol Security — Learning Notes
Overview

This repository documents my learning and experimentation with IEEE 802.11 (Wi‑Fi) protocol internals, RF behavior, and wireless security concepts.

All work here is conducted in controlled lab environments on hardware I own or have permission to test. This repository is for educational and research purposes only.
Focus Areas

    802.11 frame types and lifecycle (management, control, data)
    Client and access point behavior during association
    WPA2/WPA3 handshake concepts (theoretical analysis)
    RF concepts such as channels, signal strength, and interference
    Protocol design assumptions and security trade‑offs

What This Repository Is

    Learning notes and explanations written in my own words
    Diagrams and summaries of protocol behavior
    Observations from safe, non‑intrusive lab experiments
    Documentation of what I learned and questions I am exploring

What This Repository Is NOT

    Exploits or attack tools
    Unauthorized testing
    Weaponized proof‑of‑concepts
    Instructions to break into real networks

Tools Used

    Wireshark (packet analysis only)
    Linux (lab environment)
    IEEE 802.11 documentation and public research papers

Learning Goals

    Build a strong understanding of wireless protocol internals
    Learn how protocol design choices impact security
    Develop an ethical and responsible research mindset
    Prepare for deeper study in network and systems security

Notes
This repository will grow over time as I continue learning and refining my understanding of wireless protocols and security.
